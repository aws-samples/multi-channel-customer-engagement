# Integrating your Amazon Lex Bot with WhatsApp

We provide a quick overview of the features and capabilities of integration between WhatsApp Business API and our Amazon Lex Chatbot through Twilio.

*Note:* Twilio and WhatsApp are third-party services subject to additional terms and charges. Amazon Web Services isnâ€™t responsible for any third-party service that you use to send messages with custom channels. 

The following configuration will allow connection to a twilio sandbox to test the functionality for 24 hours. It must always be validated and configured prior to the presentation of the demo. 

## Create a twilio account and integrate it with WhatsApp 

1. Sign up for a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/console). Once you are in your dashboard, write down the following account information: *ACCOUNT SID* and *AUTH TOKEN*

2. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Lex console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex/. 

    - Choose your Amazon Lex bot.

    - Choose **Channels**.

    - Choose **Twilio SMS** under **Channels**. The console displays the Twilio SMS integration page.

    - On the Twilio SMS integration page, do the following:

        + Type the following name: TwilioWhatsApp.
        + For **Channel Description**, type the following: WhatsApp channel.
        + Select The IAM Role: AWSServiceRoleForLexChannels
        + For **KMS key**, choose **aws/lex**.
        + For **Alias**, choose the bot alias (**prod**).
        + For **Account SID**, type the **ACCOUNT SID** (obtained in the previous step)
        + For **Authentication Token**, type the **AUTH TOKEN** (obtained in the previous step)
        + Choose **Activate**.

3. Return to your Twilio dashboard. On the left menu, click *Programable Messaging*, then *Try it Out* and finally: *Try WhatsApp*. This is the first step in setting up. You can see more details of this configuration in the following [link](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/api)

   You must send the code indicated to the WhatsApp number that appears on the screen. Few seconds after you have sent the message, you will see a response on the dashboard indicating that the message has been received and you can continue with the next step: Next: Send a One-Way Message.

5. The third step, It is also informative and represents an example of the test conversations that will take place from the device. You can test the functionality by sending a reply (optional).

6. In our last step, we will take the URL callback (obtained in step 2) and place it as a parameter in the field: *WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN* and finally click on *Save*.
